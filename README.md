This is a collection of Automated Market Makers designed to make markets across all of Paradigm's products. They are first and foremost QA tools as opposed to systems examples, etc.

The AMMs use a combination of *RESToverHTTP* requests and *JSON-RPCoverWebSocket* channels to step through common workflows of a Market Maker in a crude fashion.

You can run each product either by building the docker image and running it as a docker service or you can just update the values in the respective `market-maker.py` file and run/debug.

All AMMs have been written using **Python 3.9**.

## Supported Products:
